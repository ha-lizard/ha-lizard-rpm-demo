Installing ( Replace <VERSION> with the release version noted at the top of this file )
-	Copy the source tarball into a temporary location (ex.  /tmp/)

-	Extract its contents and move into the extracted folder
	tar .zxvf ha-lizard-<VERSION>.tgz

-	Move into the scripts folder
	cd ha-lizard-<VERSION>/scripts

-	Run the installer interactively (prompts the user for some selections)
	./install

-	Optionally, the --nostart argument can be passed into the installer at runtime which will automatically install without user input AND not start services when done
	./install --nostart

The installer will install the default pool parameter set in the XAPI database. This step is only required on a single host.
Once the installer is completed, HA and watchdog services will be started automatically unless the --nostart option is passed in. ex. "./install --nostart".
Although these services are running, HA is disabled for the pool by default.
HA can then be enabled via the command line tool <ha-cfg> to enable HA once installation has been completed on all hosts within a pool.


Removing
An uninstall script is provided. This will completely remove all components from the host.
If uninstalling on a single host, skip the step which removes the settings stored in the XAPI database

-	Move into the scripts folder
	./uninstall
	follow the steps to uninstall

Upgrading
- Stop the services with "service ha-lizard stop -w"
- If changes have been made to /etc/ha-lizard/ha-lizard/conf (this is rare) then backup this file before upgrading and apply the same changes
  to the new installation after the upgrade has been completed
- Backup your current configuration using the CLI. "ha-cfg backup /path/to/file"
- Run the installer for the new version - following the instructions above for "Installing". Do not have the installer install the default
  parameter values as they will overwrite the previous configuration settings. If you accidentally destroy your configuration by having
  the installer insert the default setting then restore the previously backed up configuration with "ha-cfg restore /path/to/file"
